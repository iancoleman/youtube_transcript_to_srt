Youtube transcripts should look like this
00:02
with alternate times and text.
00:04
They often don't have punctuation so
00:05
you'll have to add it yourself.
00:07
Put the text from the transcript into
00:09
a .txt file just like this one.
00:11
Then run youtube_transcript_to_srt in
00:14
the same directory as the .txt file
00:16
and the corresponding .srt file will be created
00:19
with the same name as the .txt file, for example
00:22
this youtube transcript file is example.txt
00:24
and will be converted to example.srt when the
00:26
youtube_transcript_to_srt is run.
